**TVP Pipeline Documentation**
==============================

**Approach**
------------

The TVP Pipeline is designed to extract, transform, load, and analyze Total Value Processed (TVP) data from Dune. It provides a scalable, modular, and well-documented solution for processing large datasets and performing Top K analysis. Below is a detailed explanation of the pipeline's workflow:

### **1\. Extraction**

**Objective**: Retrieve raw data from Dune query.

*   **Method**:
    
    *   Use TVPExtractor to interact with the Dune API and fetch transaction data.
        
    *   Queries are parameterized for flexibility and stored in dune\_queries/ for reusability.
        
*   **Tools**:
    
    *   requests library for API interaction.
        
    *   Predefined Dune query with TVP methodology.
        

### **2\. Transformation**

**Objective**: Convert raw data into weekly summaries for verticals and protocols.

*   **Method**:
    
    *   Use TVPTransformer to clean, standardize, and aggregate the extracted data.
        
    *   Summarize data by:
        
        *   Week and vertical: Count of unique Safes, total transactions, and total TVP in USD.
            
        *   Week and protocol: Same metrics as above.
            
    *   Group data based on columns like vertical or protocol to produce structured summaries.
        
*   **Tools**:
    
    *   pandas for data manipulation.
        

### **3\. Loading**

**Objective**: Save the transformed data for efficient querying and upload it to Dune table.

*   **Method**:
    
    *   Use TVPLoader to:
        
        *   Save data in **Parquet** format for local storage.
                        
        *   Upload the data to the Dune table.
                    
*   **Tools**:
    
    *   pandas for Parquet file handling.
        
    *   requests for Dune API interactions.
        

### **4\. Analysis**

**Objective**: Perform Top K analysis for verticals and protocols.

*   **Method**:
    
    *   Use SparkTVPAnalyzer to process transformed data using Apache Spark.
        
    *   Identify the Top 5 verticals and protocols by:
        
        *   Highest transaction volume.
            
        *   Highest transaction count.
            
*   **Tools**:
    
    *   **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing.
        

**Assumptions**
---------------

1.  **Data Completeness**:
    
    *   The data retrieved from Dune is assumed to be accurate, complete, and pre-validated.
        
    *   Any anomalies or missing data are considered out of scope for this implementation.
        
2.  **Schema Stability**:
    
    *   The structure of the Dune data (e.g., column names and types) remains consistent over time.
        
3.  **Vertical and Protocol Mapping**:
    
    *   Labels used to classify verticals and protocols in the queries are sufficient to categorize all transactions.
        
4.  **Scalability**:
    
    *   The pipeline is designed to scale with large datasets, assuming sufficient resources (e.g., memory, processing power) are available.
        

**Limitations**
---------------

### **1\. Lack of Data Quality Checks**

Due to time constraints, the pipeline does not include a dedicated module for data quality checks. However, this is a critical aspect for production-grade pipelines. Below are key checks that should be implemented:

*   **Schema Validation**:
    
    *   Ensure incoming data adheres to the expected schema.
        
*   **Null and Duplicate Checks**:
    
    *   Identify and handle missing or duplicated rows.
        
*   **Outlier Detection**:
    
    *   Flag unusually high or low values in amount\_usd or transaction counts.
            

**Future Improvements**
-----------------------

### **1\. Data Quality Module**

*   Add a TVPDataValidator class to:
    
    *   Perform schema validation.
        
    *   Check for null values, duplicates, and outliers.
        
    *   Generate data quality reports for debugging.
        

### **2\. Improved Error Handling**

*   Enhance error handling in all modules to:
    
    *   Retry failed API calls.
        
    *   Log detailed error messages for debugging.
        

### **3\. Advanced Analytics**

*   Extend the analysis to include:
    
    *   Trends over time (e.g., monthly growth rates for verticals and protocols).
        
    *   Cross-category comparisons.
        

### **4\. CI/CD Integration**

*   Automate testing and deployment using CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.
    

### **Automating the ETL Task with Apache Airflow**

To automate the ETL task in the TVP pipeline, I recommend using **Apache Airflow** as a data orchestration tool. Airflow provides a robust framework for scheduling, monitoring, and managing ETL workflows, making it an ideal choice for automating complex pipelines like this one.

### **Why Apache Airflow?**

1.  **Scheduling and Automation**:
    
    *   Airflow allows us to define ETL workflows as DAGs, which can be scheduled to run at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
        
    *   This eliminates the need for manual intervention, ensuring the pipeline runs consistently and on time.
        
2.  **Modularity**:
    
    *   Each step of the ETL process (Extraction, Transformation, Loading, and Analysis) can be defined as a separate **task** in Airflow.
        
    *   Tasks can be organized into reusable components, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
        
3.  **Monitoring and Alerting**:
    
    *   Airflow provides a web-based UI to monitor task execution, view logs, and track the progress of workflows.
        
    *   Alerts can be configured to notify the team in case of failures.
        
4.  **Extensibility**:
    
    *   Airflow supports a wide range of integrations with APIs, databases, and cloud services, including Dune, Spark, and distributed file systems.
        
    *   Custom operators can be created to handle specific tasks, such as fetching data from Dune or uploading results.
        

### **Benefits of Automation**

1.  **Consistency**:
    
    *   Ensures the ETL process is executed reliably at regular intervals without manual oversight.
        
2.  **Scalability**:
    
    *   As the dataset grows, Airflow can orchestrate tasks across distributed environments to handle increasing loads.
        
3.  **Traceability**:
    
    *   Task logs and execution history provide a clear audit trail for debugging and optimization.
        
4.  **Team Efficiency**:
    
    *   Automation frees up time for the team to focus on higher-level tasks, such as enhancing analytics and developing new features.


**Conclusion**
--------------

The TVP Pipeline is a robust starting point for analyzing Total Value Processed (TVP) data. It emphasizes modularity, scalability, and clear documentation while balancing simplicity and functionality. Despite current limitations, it provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, particularly in data quality and advanced analytics.
